TO-DO:
-restructure user-picks, backend should not differentiate between new_picks and updated picks
-have 2 separate routes for new picks and updated picks

-finish matchup update for backend
-after dispatch locks a matchup, sends fetch request to back end and updates all matchups with the same game time

-fetch teams on app load, teams should be loaded when the app starts
-matchups use team ids as a reference for the team array stored in the global state, instead of loading serialized
 teams every time

-cleanup unused components/functions
