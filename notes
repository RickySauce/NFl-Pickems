TO-DO:
-restructure user-picks, backend should not differentiate between new_picks and updated picks
-have 2 separate routes for new picks and updated picks

-finish matchup update for backend
-after dispatch locks a matchup, sends fetch request to back end and updates all matchups with the same game time

-user can click on team before dispatch locks matchups, must add additional logic to prevent this and or remove it.

-currentWeek persisted on the back end, is this neccessary? can set currentWeek when fetched to first week that isn't locked

-refactor currentWeek, currentSeason. current week and current season should be relative. current season is set on new season
current weeks should be set when the initial current week is locked
